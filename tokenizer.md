`echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt.`

This command would be tokenized as follows:

`echo` - This is a `WORD` token. It's the name of the command to be executed.

` `(space) - This is a `SPACE` token. It separates the command from its arguments.

`"Hello, World!"` - This is a `D_QUOTE` token followed by a `WORD` token followed by another `D_QUOTE` token. The D_QUOTE tokens represent the start and end of a double-quoted string, and the `WORD`token represents the string itself.

` `(space) - This is another `SPACE` token. It separates the command and its arguments from the redirection operator.

`>` - This is a `GREAT` token. It represents the redirection operator, which redirects the output of the command to a file.

` `(space) - This is another `SPACE` token. It separates the redirection operator from the file name.

`output.txt` - This is another `WORD` token. It represents the name of the file to which the output should be redirected.

So the tokenized command would look something like this:

```
[WORD("echo"), SPACE, D_QUOTE, WORD("Hello, World!"), D_QUOTE, SPACE, GREAT, SPACE, WORD("output.txt")]
```
