`echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt.`

This command would be tokenized as follows:

`echo` - This is a `WORD` token. It's the name of the command to be executed.

` `(space) - This is a `SPACE` token. It separates the command from its arguments.

`"Hello, World!"` - This is a `D_QUOTE` token followed by a `WORD` token followed by another `D_QUOTE` token. The D_QUOTE tokens represent the start and end of a double-quoted string, and the `WORD`token represents the string itself.

` `(space) - This is another `SPACE` token. It separates the command and its arguments from the redirection operator.

`>` - This is a `GREAT` token. It represents the redirection operator, which redirects the output of the command to a file.

` `(space) - This is another `SPACE` token. It separates the redirection operator from the file name.

`output.txt` - This is another `WORD` token. It represents the name of the file to which the output should be redirected.

So the tokenized command would look something like this:

```
[WORD("echo"), SPACE, D_QUOTE, WORD("Hello, World!"), D_QUOTE, SPACE, GREAT, SPACE, WORD("output.txt")]
```

Each token in this list would be represented as a t_tok_list struct, with the str field containing the string representation of the token and the type field containing the type of the token. The next field would point to the next token in the list.
