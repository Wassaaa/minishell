## About The Project

Minishell is a simple, minimalistic shell implemented in C. It provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.

### Requirements
- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command
- Have a working history
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path)
- Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal
- Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon)
- Handle â€™ (single quote) and " (double quote) in command input
- Implement redirections: `<` for input, `>` for output, `<<` for input until a delimiter, `>>` for output in append mode
- Implement pipes (`|`)
- Handle environment variables (`$` followed by a sequence of characters)
- Handle `$?` which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash
- Implement the following builtins: `echo` with option `-n`, `cd` with only a relative or absolute path, `pwd` with no options, `export` with no options, `unset` with no options, `env` with no options or arguments, `exit` with no options
