## About The Project

Minishell is a simple, mini shell implemented in C. It provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.

### Requirements
- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command
- Have a working history
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path)
- Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal
- Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon)
- Handle â€™ (single quote) and " (double quote) in command input
- Implement redirections:
	- `<` redirect input
	- `>` redirect output
 	- `<<` for input until a delimiter (heredoc)
  	- `>>` for output in append mode
- Implement pipes (`|`)
- Handle environment variables (`$` followed by a sequence of characters)
- Handle `$?` which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
- Handle `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` and `ctrl-\` which should behave like in bash
- Implement the following builtins: 
    - `echo` with option `-n`
    - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
    - `pwd` with no options
    - `export` with no options
    - `unset` with no options
    - `env` with no options or arguments
    - `exit` with no options
 
ðŸš« No Implementation Needed
- && and ||
- wildcards
- special symbols that were not specifically asked for
